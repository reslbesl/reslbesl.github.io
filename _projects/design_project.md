I was involved in the development and design of many real-world systems in which privacy played a key role.

As part of the DP-3T project, I helped to develop a protocol for privacy-preserving decentralised proximity tracing {% cite TroncosoPH20 %} that was later adopted by many countries around the world {% cite TroncosoBB22 %}.
At Privitar, I worked with a large number of organisations, across sectors and industries, to find general purpose technologies to enable the ethical and safe use of data {% cite Cabot2022method Mcfall2023computer %}. 

**Impact**

The work of the DP3T consortium had an immense impact world-wide during the COVID19 pandemic.
